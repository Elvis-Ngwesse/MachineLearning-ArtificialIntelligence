# 🧭 Roadmap: DevOps/Test Engineer → AI/ML Engineer

---

## 🔹 Phase 1: Groundwork (Month 1–2)

**🎯 Goal:** Build solid foundations in Python, math, and basic ML workflows.

**Topics:**
- Python (NumPy, pandas, matplotlib)
- Linear algebra, probability, statistics
- Regression, classification, overfitting, underfitting
- Model evaluation: accuracy, precision, recall, ROC AUC

**Resources:**
- [Coursera: Machine Learning by Andrew Ng](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning)
- [Kaggle Python + Pandas Microcourses](https://www.kaggle.com/learn)

---

## 🔹 Phase 2: Hands-On ML Projects (Month 2–4)

**🎯 Goal:** Start applying ML on real data using automation and monitoring best practices.

**Tools:**
- `scikit-learn`, `xgboost`, `matplotlib`
- Flask/FastAPI, Docker, GitHub Actions
- Prometheus + Grafana

**Project Ideas:**
- 🏥 Anomaly detection using system metrics
- 💬 NLP classifier for support tickets or logs
- 📦 Auto-scaling predictor using time series ML

---

## 🔹 Phase 3: Deep Learning & NLP (Month 4–6)

**🎯 Goal:** Master deep learning and transformers for real-world AI use-cases.

**Topics:**
- Neural networks, CNNs, RNNs
- Text classification, sentiment analysis
- Transfer learning and transformers (e.g., BERT)

**Resources:**
- [DeepLearning.AI TensorFlow Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/tensorflow-in-practice)
- [Hugging Face Course](https://huggingface.co/learn)

**Projects:**
- 🧾 NLP QA Assistant with transformers
- 📢 Voice emotion classifier with Whisper + BERT

---

## 🔹 Phase 4: MLOps Integration (Month 6–8)

**🎯 Goal:** Build and deploy robust ML pipelines using DevOps best practices.

**Topics & Tools:**
- MLflow, DVC for model tracking/versioning
- Airflow or Prefect for orchestration
- FastAPI, Docker, Kubernetes for serving
- Monitoring with Prometheus/Grafana
- Logging and tracing via OpenTelemetry

**Projects:**
- 🚀 End-to-end ML pipeline with CI/CD
- 🌐 Model monitoring with metrics and drift detection

---

## 🔹 Phase 5: Specialization + Certification (Month 8–12)

**🎯 Goal:** Validate skills and specialize in MLOps or Applied ML.

**Certifications:**
- ✅ TensorFlow Developer Certificate
- ✅ AWS Certified Machine Learning – Specialty
- ✅ Google Cloud ML Engineer
- ✅ Hugging Face NLP Certificate (when available)
- ✅ DataCamp ML Professional Certificate

---

## 💼 Target Roles After Completion

| Role | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **MLOps Engineer** | Build & maintain ML pipelines, deploy models |
| **Applied ML Engineer** | Train and serve ML models |
| **AI Platform Engineer** | Build infrastructure for ML teams |
| **AI Quality/Test Engineer** | Validate and test ML models |
| **Data Scientist (Junior)** | Analyze and model structured/unstructured data |

---

## 🧠 Pro Tips

- Keep learning **1 project at a time**
- Contribute to OSS (e.g., Hugging Face, MLflow, DVC)
- Publish your work (GitHub, Medium, LinkedIn)
- Build a portfolio with end-to-end ML projects (train → deploy → monitor)
