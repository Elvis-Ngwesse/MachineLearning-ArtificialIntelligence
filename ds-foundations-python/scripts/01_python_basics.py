    This means:
    "Start from 2, and go up to n-1."
    Example: if n = 7, it checks: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
You're looping over all possible divisors of n (except 1 and n itself).

 if n % i == 0:

    This means:
    "If n divided by i has no remainder, then i divides n exactly."

    The % operator is called modulo â€” it gives the remainder.
